Earlier one application on one server.
VM WARE-virtual machines solve this problem

DOCKER solves problems like:-
    1.Virtual machine problem we need a operating system.
        =>one Operating System run all application in one Virtual Machine.
        ..Containers-Users like Google, Microsoft uses same container concept before docker but they are not that
        much popular.
        ->
    2.Dependencies management.
    3.It work on my machine but it doesn't work on your machine.
    4.Migration of code is also time consuming.
    5.Contributing to opensource and setup project on your system.

CONTAINERS:-
    for Windows-DOCKER DESKTOP + WSL (windows subsystem for linux)
    mac-VM's and DOCKER DESKTOP
    linux - as it is

#DOCKER RUNTIME  
-run c =it works with OS , it start and stop the Containers.
-containerd=role is to manage runc, it help in interaction with network,how to get data from network
           =contain runtime for KuberNetes

#DOCKER ENGINE, DOCKER DAEMON
-We use to interact with Docker           

docker container has some os to 
#DOCKER COMMANDS
docker run hello-world
docker run -it ubuntu
docker pull 
docker container ls
docker pull mysql //to pulldirect image
docker images
docker pull ubuntu:16.04 //to change version by default latest download
root@...../# ps aux
docker ps //to see currently running packages
docker container exec -it b47a93d1 bash
docker stop id(b4j2n5s8fb4j)
docker ps -a //show all the container that are stocked
docker rm id(b4j2n5s8fb4j)
docker inspect ubuntu or (id)
docker log id(b4j2n5s8fb4j) //all output displays.
docker container prune -f //delete all the containers.
docker run -d alpine ping www.civo.com
docker ps //give id of the container in which backgroud is running
docker run ubuntu echo Hey
docker logs {id some letter(9694)}
docker logs --since 5s 9694
docker stop 9694
docker rm 9694
docker rmi alpine -f //to remove image alpine
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx //to run in my own port

#to share container with someone
docker run -it ubuntu
root@../# ls
root@../# touch names.txt
root@../# echo "Hey my name is ARYAN">> names.txt
root@../# cat names.txt
root@../# exit

docker start 062a4654j
docker exec -it 062a4654j bash

root@../# ls
docker exit

docker commit -m "added names.txt file" 062a4654j names_ubuntu:1.01
docker images
docker ps
docker stop
docker images
docker run -it names_ubuntu:1.01
root@../# ls

docker images -q //gives all ids 
docker rmi $(docker images -q) //to remove all images
docker rmi $(docker images -q) -f //to force

ubuntu image is itself made up of 4 files
called layers
if mongodb uses any file which is already download by ubuntu
so images share layers so that not need to download it again

#CREATE Docker hub account
docker login 
put username password

#NOW BUILT image
touch Dockerfile //capital convention
vi Dockerfile
put valuses
FROM ubuntu:16.04
RUN apt-get update
CMD["echo", "Hello World"] ,  to exit :x
cat Dockerfile
output print
docker build -t myimage .
^C% //to stop data transfer
mkdir project
mv Dockerfile project //relocate
cd project
docker build -t myimage .
docker run myimage
